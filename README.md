==================

Some additional functionality for the Google Maps API (v3)

The new Polygon.randomInternalLatLng call generates a a point contained within the bounds of the Polygon. Open example.html in a browser to see it in action.

Tests for the code are contained in tests.coffee. To run the tests and see the results, open tests.html in a browser.

Code was stolen from all around the internet. Special thanks to Wikipedia, postgis, Google Maps V2...too many to name.
